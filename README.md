# ShockRelationsMath
## Introduction
Shock Relations Math is a from scratch project for equations and math surrounding shock waves and their properties. 

The main goals of this project is to create an easy set of functions to run and use shock relations math within other applications. As such, there is no complete program in this project, only libraries and classes. These are each written in a few programming languages to allow for an easy implementation.

## Features
### Normal Shock Relations
This is the function set that allows calculations describing normal shock waves. 

## Contributing
Thank you for your interest in expanding this collection of shock relations functions! We love to see new developers work on them. Simply create a pull request with your new code.
